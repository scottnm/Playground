# Playground

This repository is a collection of programs I've written for the purposes of learning about new technologies, concepts, and techniques. Some projects are just following along with pre-written tutorials and others are self-directed micro-projects that are simple enough to do in a day but deep enough to give me a deeper sense of exposure to some new "thing".
