# RustySorts

Got super embarassed when I couldn't remember basic sorting algorithms
in a lecture today. Here's my attempt to correct that.

I plan to implement each once in Python and once in Rust.

## Goals

* Reinforce Python for SWE
* Become more familiar with Rust
* Keep my data structures thinking up to code
* Work with virtualenv in python
* Reinforce TDD and unit testing practices

## Extended Goals

* Display sort timing visualization using Flask and Numpy
